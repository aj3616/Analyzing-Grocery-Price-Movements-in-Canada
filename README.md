# Analyzing Price Movements in Bundled Products (Eggs, Milk, Bread) in Canada

## Overview
This project investigates whether the prices of commonly bundled grocery products (Eggs, Milk, Bread) move in tandem at a single grocery vendor. Using Bayesian modeling and correlation analysis, the study explores price relationships and dependencies over time, focusing on vendor-specific dynamics. R is used for data manipulation and analysis. Special thanks to: Jacob Flipp for project hammer data set and Rohan Alexander for instructions and templates.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` omit because file size, can be found https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/
-   `data/analysis_data` omit because file size, can reprduce with 02-cleaning_data.R
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

## Statement on LLM Usage
This project utilized a Large Language Model (ChatGpt4o) to assist with code generation, documentation, and interpretation of results. All outputs were reviewed and documented to ensure accuracy and alignment with the research objectives. The LLM facilitated efficient development and provided structured solutions for data analysis and modeling.
